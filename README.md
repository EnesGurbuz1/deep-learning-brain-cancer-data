# Deep Learning Final Project

This report was prepared as the final project for the **Deep Learning** course at the Karadeniz Technical University, Faculty of Technology, Department of Software Engineering.

## Challenges

During the project, the following constraints and penalties were applied:

- **Maximum Epoch Limit:**  
  Training was restricted to a maximum of **50 epochs**.

- **Layer Penalty:**  
  For each additional layer used in the model, **1 point was deducted** from the final project score.


## Data Split

The dataset was divided into the following portions:

- **Training:** 70%  
- **Validation:** 15%  
- **Test:** 15%

## Model Training

- The training process was monitored using **early stopping**.  
- Training was halted after the **34th epoch**.

## Learning Curves

The learning curves during training were analyzed in detail (can be visualized in the Colab notebook).

## Results

| Phase       | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| âœ… Training  | 0.9559   |
| âœ… Validation| 0.9669   |
| âœ… Test      | 0.9693   |
